# Greedy Algorithm
A greedy algorithm solves <b>optimization probelm</b> by making the best choice at eah step (locally optimal ) hoping that :
---> "Local optimum = Global Optimum"

## Pros 
<li> Simple and Easy </li>
<li> Good enough Time complexity </li>

## Cons
<li> A lot of time global optimum is not achieved </li>
